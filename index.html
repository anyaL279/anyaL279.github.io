<p> My family sticks to me like tree sap, you don't really want it there, but it doesn't really come off. <strong> Tree sap </strong>.</p>
<p> <em> Types of Sap!</em></p>
<ul> 
    <li>1 Redwood Tress sap, has a great pull, so you think you got some time away. But then they are back</li>
    <li> Birtch sap, its considerably thin, so on occasion it can be removed. </li>
    <li> Mayple sap, this is one of the only enjoyable forms of sap. On rare occation, it can be nice to be stuck with family</li>
